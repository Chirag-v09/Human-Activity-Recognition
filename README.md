# Video-Classification
Video Classification on Dataset UCF 11

Classification is done on 11 categories using Trnsfer Learning using pretrained model VGG16 224 resolution trained on imagenet dataset of 1000 categories.

Dataset available here :- https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF_YouTube_Action.php

# After this I also done classification on UCF 101 dataset

Recognition is done on 101 categories using Transfer Learning using pre-trained model ResNet50 224 reolution trained on imagenet dataset of 1000 categories

Dataset is avaliable here :- https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php

I personally extract the images from the videos and upload it to the kaggle so if you want the you can use that dataset.
